## Structures

### InclusionListEntryV1

The fields are encoded as follows:

- `address`: `DATA` - 20 byte address of the entry.
- `gasLimit`: `QUANTITY` - 64 bit max amount of gas consumed by the transaction.

### ExecutionPayloadV4

This structure has the syntax of [`ExecutionPayloadV3`](./cancun.md#executionpayloadv3) and appends the new fields: `inclusionListSummary` and `inclusionListExclusions`.

- `parentHash`: `DATA`, 32 Bytes
- `feeRecipient`:  `DATA`, 20 Bytes
- `stateRoot`: `DATA`, 32 Bytes
- `receiptsRoot`: `DATA`, 32 Bytes
- `logsBloom`: `DATA`, 256 Bytes
- `prevRandao`: `DATA`, 32 Bytes
- `blockNumber`: `QUANTITY`, 64 Bits
- `gasLimit`: `QUANTITY`, 64 Bits
- `gasUsed`: `QUANTITY`, 64 Bits
- `timestamp`: `QUANTITY`, 64 Bits
- `extraData`: `DATA`, 0 to 32 Bytes
- `baseFeePerGas`: `QUANTITY`, 256 Bits
- `blockHash`: `DATA`, 32 Bytes
- `transactions`: `Array of DATA` - Array of transaction objects, each object is a byte list (`DATA`) representing `TransactionType || TransactionPayload` or `LegacyTransaction` as defined in [EIP-2718](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2718)
- `withdrawals`: `Array of WithdrawalV1` - Array of withdrawals, each object is an `OBJECT` containing the fields of a `WithdrawalV1` structure.
- `blobGasUsed`: `QUANTITY`, 64 Bits
- `excessBlobGas`: `QUANTITY`, 64 Bits
- `inclusionListSummary`: `Array of InclusionListEntryV1` - Array of entries, each object is an `OBJECT` containing the fields in `InclusionListEntryV1` structure.

### PayloadAttributesV4

This structure has the syntax of [`PayloadAttributesV3`](./cancun.md#payloadattributesv3) and appends the new fields: `inclusionListTransactions` and `inclusionListExclusions`.

- `timestamp`: `QUANTITY`, 64 Bits - value for the `timestamp` field of the new payload
- `prevRandao`: `DATA`, 32 Bytes - value for the `prevRandao` field of the new payload
- `suggestedFeeRecipient`: `DATA`, 20 Bytes - suggested value for the `feeRecipient` field of the new payload
- `withdrawals`: `Array of WithdrawalV1` - Array of withdrawals, each object is an `OBJECT` containing the fields of a `WithdrawalV1` structure.
- `parentBeaconBlockRoot`: `DATA`, 32 Bytes - Root of the parent beacon block.
- `inclusionListTransations`: `Array of DATA` - Array of transaction objects, each object is a byte list (`DATA`) representing `TransactionType || TransactionPayload` or `LegacyTransaction` as defined in [EIP-2718](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2718)
- `inclusionListExclusions`: `Array of QUANTITY` - Array of 64 bit unsigned ints which represent the indices of the entries in the summary that are already satisfied.

## Methods

### engine_newPayloadV4

#### Request

* method: `engine_newPayloadV4`
* params:
  1. `executionPayload`: [`ExecutionPayloadV4`](#ExecutionPayloadV4).
  2. `expectedBlobVersionedHashes`: `Array of DATA`, 32 Bytes - Array of expected blob versioned hashes to validate.
  3. `parentBeaconBlockRoot`: `DATA`, 32 Bytes - Root of the parent beacon block.

#### Response

Refer to the response for [`engine_newPayloadV3`](./cancun.md#engine_newpayloadv3).

#### Specification

This method follows the same specification as [`engine_newPayloadV3`](./cancun.md#engine_newpayloadv3) with the addition of the following:

1. Client software **MUST** check that provided inclusion list summary is satisfied. Each entry in the summary must either below to the exclusion list or have a transaction in the payload from that address.

### engine_forkchoiceUpdatedV4

#### Request

* method: `engine_forkchoiceUpdatedV4`
* params:
  1. `forkchoiceState`: [`ForkchoiceStateV1`](./paris.md#ForkchoiceStateV1).
  2. `payloadAttributes`: `Object|null` - Instance of [`PayloadAttributesV4`](#payloadattributesv4) or `null`.
* timeout: 8s

#### Response

Refer to the response for [`engine_forkchoiceUpdatedV3`](./cancun.md#engine_forkchoiceupdatedv3).

#### Specification

This method follows the same specification as [`engine_forkchoiceUpdatedV3`](./cancun.md#engine_forkchoiceupdatedv3) with the addition of the following:

1. Client software **MUST** begin building the inclusion list if the `payloadAttributes` are supplied.

### engine_getPayloadV4

The response of this method is extended to have the [`ExecutionPayloadV4`](#executionpayloadv4) type.

#### Request

* method: `engine_getPayloadV4`
* params:
  1. `payloadId`: `DATA`, 8 Bytes - Identifier of the payload build process
* timeout: 1s

#### Response

* result: `object`
  - `executionPayload`: [`ExecutionPayloadV4`](#ExecutionPayloadV4)
  - `blockValue` : `QUANTITY`, 256 Bits - The expected value to be received by the `feeRecipient` in wei
  - `blobsBundle`: [`BlobsBundleV1`](#BlobsBundleV1) - Bundle with data corresponding to blob transactions included into `executionPayload`
  - `shouldOverrideBuilder` : `BOOLEAN` - Suggestion from the execution layer to use this `executionPayload` instead of an externally provided one
* error: code and message set in case an exception happens while getting the payload.

#### Specification

Refer to the specification for [`engine_getPayloadV3`](./cancun.md#engine_getpayloadv3).

### engine_getInclusionListV1

#### Request

* method: `engine_getInclusionListV1`
* params:
  1. `payloadId`: `DATA`, 8 Bytes - Identifier of the payload build process
* timeout: 1s

#### Response

* result: `object`
  - `inclusionListSummary`: `Array of InclusionListEntryV1` - Array of entries, each object is an `OBJECT` containing the fields in `InclusionListEntryV1` structure.
  - `inclusionListTransations`: `Array of DATA` - Array of transaction objects, each object is a byte list (`DATA`) representing `TransactionType || TransactionPayload` or `LegacyTransaction` as defined in [EIP-2718](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2718)
* error: code and message set in case an exception happens while getting the inclusion list.

#### Specification

1. Client software **MUST** provide a list of transactions for the inclusion list based on local view of the mempool.
